how do i do it with printf in the c file? how can I print ""? --> \

Idea for more efficiency: make a  variable that changes every case and a poitner that counts the amoint of times we get in the same case.
after the switch case, we analyse these two and if it changed from the last time I print something in the c file.
Maybe a additional variable to save the TAPE[HEAD]. because the interpreter changed the tape in the mean time
-> i could compare the old cell value with the new one (in case of add and minus)
-> for printing i need to save data bevore printing  the data --> change -->print (list structure?)
-> the beginning and end of procs need to be directly printed
-> what with loops? -> does something that long until the cell were we are bevor the loop is 0;


issues:

[ ]check the proc, not shure if it is working that easy
[ ] tab += '/t' ?? snprintf maybe or strcpy, or strncpy(word2,word,strlen(word)-1);

What I did:
changed the filename in "main" --> achtung bei ihm bei -c und bei -o UND in translate
deleted my part from "init" and made a new function "cHeader"
added my functions to the .h file
added unsigned short oldOperator; --> variable and newOperator;
