how do i do it with printf in the c file? how can I print ""?

Idea for more efficiency: make a  variable that changes every case and a poitner that counts the amoint of times we get in the same case. 
after the switch case, we analyse these two and if it changed from the last time I print something in the c file.
Maybe a additional variable to save the TAPE[HEAD]. because the interpreter changed the tape in the mean time 
-> i could compare the old cell value with the new one (in case of add and minus)
-> for printing i need to save data bevore printing  the data --> change -->print (list structure?)
-> the beginning and end of procs need to be directly printed
-> what with loops? -> does something that long until we are at the beginning of the tape? (we start in the middle of the tape)

Claculators, paper, web calculators are possible
