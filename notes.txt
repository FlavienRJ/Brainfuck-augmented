issues:

[ ]check the proc, not shure if it is working that easy
[ ] tab += '/t' ?? snprintf maybe or strcpy, or strncpy(word2,word,strlen(word)-1);
What I did:
changed the filename in "main" --> achtung bei ihm bei -c und bei -o UND in translate
deleted my part from "init" and made a new function "cHeader"
added my functions to the .h file
added unsigned short oldOperator; --> variable and newOperator;
the last instruction.
